## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.86.1] – 2026-05-06

Patch release alignment after the `v0.86.0` tag failed before publish at the MCP registry serialization gate.

### Fixed
- **MCP registry release serialization** — reformatted the bundled registry with the canonical Unicode-preserving serializer so the release gate no longer mutates `src/agent_bom/mcp_registry.json` at tag time.
- **Pre-tag registry serialization guard** — `scripts/check_release_consistency.py` now verifies MCP registry serialization stability during normal CI/pre-release checks, preventing this class of failure from reaching the tag workflow again.
- **Short-description limit guard** — release consistency now enforces the 100-character publish limit for the package short description before release workflows reach registry publication.

## [0.86.0] – 2026-05-03

AI-infra and supply-chain breadth release: ATLAS catalog wired through to dashboard, Snowflake Native App Phases 1–3 with DCM as a first-class IaC type, GPU cloud + driver/firmware coverage (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA, Lambda Labs / RunPod / Vast.ai / Crusoe / Nebius), Compliance Hub closed end-to-end (#1044), plus two new content scanners (SPDX licenses, dataset PII/PHI).

### Added
- **Compliance Hub series** — `compliance_hub.py` engine plus four ingestion adapters (SARIF / CycloneDX / CSV / JSON) and four hub API endpoints (`POST /v1/compliance/ingest`, `GET /v1/compliance/hub/findings`, `GET /v1/compliance/hub/posture`, `DELETE /v1/compliance/hub/findings`) so external scanner output lands in the same per-tenant posture surface as native scans. Closes #1044 (#2200, #2201, #2203, #2204).
- **Durable Compliance Hub backends** — SQLite and Postgres stores back the hub with tenant-scoped persistence and reserved-namespace tenant validation, replacing the in-memory placeholder (#2205).
- **MITRE ATLAS catalog refresh** — `atlas_fetch.py` pulls from `mitre-atlas/atlas-data` so the catalog stays current; CI guards against drift (#2215).
- **IaC → ATLAS mapping for AI infra** — Terraform / Helm / K8s findings annotate the matching ATLAS technique IDs so dashboards can pivot from infra control gaps to adversary technique coverage (#2216).
- **ATLAS coverage tile on dashboard** — `/compliance` page surfaces the bundled MITRE ATLAS catalog (version, curated-vs-upstream technique count, last-updated) so users can verify the catalog they are matching against (#2217).
- **Snowflake Native App Phase 1** — manifest, customer-approved access policy, DCM module, and tenancy boundary (#2210, #2220).
- **Snowflake Native App Phase 2** — Snowpark stored procedure that materialises Compliance Hub posture inside the customer's Snowflake account; results never leave tenant boundary (#2226).
- **Snowflake Native App Phase 3** — SPCS-hosted Next.js UI with service-role binding so customers run the full agent-bom dashboard inside Snowpark Container Services (#2227).
- **Snowflake DCM as first-class IaC type** — DCM scripts get a dedicated parser and finding namespace alongside Terraform/Helm/K8s/CFN/Pulumi (#2218, #2222).
- **DCM fullstack wiring + IAM-to-agent graph edges** — DCM resources flow through the scan pipeline into the graph; IAM principals get a `MANAGES` edge to derived agents (#2233).
- **IaC scanner context — two-gate dispatch, capability verdicts, deployment-aware** — scanners now carry deployment context so the verdict reflects "what this manifest actually deploys" rather than syntactic posture (#2223).
- **AMD advisory scanner** — AMD PSIRT advisory ingestion + GPU driver CVE mapping + K8s GPU compound rules (#2224).
- **AMD PSIRT live-feed fetcher** — keeps AMD advisory data fresh; falls back to a checked-in static seed if the upstream feed is unreachable (#2230).
- **AMD/Intel driver CVE gates + Intel advisory feed + K8S-036** — per-node driver checks for both vendors plus a K8s rule (`K8S-036`) for `nvidia-device-plugin` RBAC scope (#2232).
- **Intel i915/xe driver CVE gate** — per-node check for CVE-2023-22655 / CVE-2023-25546; reads `/sys/module/i915/version` or `/sys/module/xe/version` via `kubectl exec`, falls back to `uname -r` (#2236).
- **NVIDIA DGX/HGX firmware + BMC advisories** — `firmware_advisory.py` ships a 6-CVE NVIDIA CSAF seed (3× H100 BMC/CLI critical/high, DGX A100 SBIOS, ConnectX-6 DoS, DGX Station A100 OOB write); per-node product mapping via GPU-model labels; surfaces through `GpuInfraReport.firmware_findings` and `risk_summary.firmware_cve_count` (#2236).
- **Container image SBOM (RunPod / Vast.ai)** — `container_sbom.py` fetches Docker Hub registry v2 metadata (manifest digest, config labels, layer size). Emits `UNPINNED_TAG`, `NO_SBOM_ATTESTATION`, `STALE_IMAGE` (>180d), `MISSING_PROVENANCE` findings; offline-safe and graceful on token/manifest failures; per-process `lru_cache` so duplicate pods share one Docker Hub round-trip (#2236).
- **GPU cloud provider discovery** — Lambda Labs, RunPod, Vast.ai, and Crusoe added to the cloud catalog; agents emerge with `cloud_origin.provider` set to the right vendor (#2229).
- **Nebius InfiniBand training job discovery** — Nebius training jobs and their InfiniBand fabric scope are discovered as agents (#2231).
- **SPDX license file scanner** — detects `LICENSE` / `COPYING` files and SPDX source-header markers across the inventory; results feed the existing license posture surface (#2234).
- **Dataset PII/PHI content scanner** — CSV / JSON / JSONL content scanner that flags datasets containing PII/PHI columns or values (#2235).
- **Identity and naming contract hardening** — locks the platform identity / canonical-name vocabulary so downstream surfaces stop drifting (#2207).
- **`summary.unique_packages` field on JSON output** — disambiguates occurrence count from the deduplicated package count so dashboards stop double-counting transitive duplicates (#2199).
- **`summary.total_packages` semantics clarified** — documented as occurrence-shaped to match the existing wire format and pair with `unique_packages` (#2199).

### Fixed
- **`--self-scan` walks the active venv** — `_build_self_scan_inventory` now uses `importlib.metadata.distributions()` so transitive deps appear in the inventory (#2197).
- **Dashboard splash kind classification on `/compliance` and `/vulns`** — auth and forbidden errors now render distinct copy instead of the generic "Cannot connect" splash (#2199).
- **v0.85.0 multi-persona audit P1 items** — close-out doc fixes for the persona-targeted README/docs surfaces flagged in the v0.85.0 review (#2208).
- **Compliance Hub posture aggregates all 15 frameworks** — posture endpoint no longer truncates at the first frameworks; CHANGELOG synced in the same PR to match shipped behaviour (#2221).
- **Docker Hub short description trimmed to 100-char API limit** — release publish step no longer 422s on the description sync (#2225).

### Documentation
- **`--self-scan` flag reference** added to the CLI docs (#2202).
- **Compliance SVG framework alignment** with `COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS` so the diagram and code list never drift (#2206).
- **Policy-precedence + runtime-reference consolidation** — single source of truth for how runtime gating, firewall, and proxy policies interact (#2209).

### CI
- **DCM scanner self-check** — meta-recursive job runs the DCM scanner against the agent-bom-shipped DCM manifests on every PR (#2228).

## [0.85.0] – 2026-05-02

Two new product surfaces (inter-agent firewall + per-run discovery envelope) plus four audit-driven defect fixes from the v0.84.6 hands-on review.

### Added
- **Inter-agent firewall** — tenant-scoped policy engine for agent → agent delegation. Pairwise + role-tag rules with `allow` / `deny` / `warn-only` decisions, dry-run mode for safe rollouts, hot-reloadable policy file. Decisions emit through the existing `/v1/proxy/audit` HMAC-chained audit relay. CLI: `agent-bom firewall validate / list / check`. Runtime card on the gateway dashboard tab. Issue #982 closed by #2188 / #2189 / #2190 / #2191.
- **Per-run discovery envelope** (#2083) — every discovered Agent now carries a trust contract recording the actual scan mode, explicit scope, IAM/API permissions exercised, and redaction posture for that run. Locked enums (`scan_mode`, `redaction_status`), schema-versioned (`envelope_version: 1`), surfaced through the existing `/v1/agents` API and a new `DiscoveryEnvelopeCard` on agent detail with a data-residency note. Wired on AWS, GCP, Azure, CoreWeave, Nebius, Snowflake, Databricks, MLflow, W&B, HuggingFace, OpenAI, and Ollama. Cross-provider least-privilege + redaction lock-in matrix tests every catalog entry against an explicit read-only verb allowlist (`Get` / `List` / `Describe` / `Search` / `Read` / `Select` / `View` / `Retrieve` / `Show` / `Fetch` / `Scan` / `watch` / `GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`). Issue #2083 closed by #2192 / #2193 / #2194 / #2195.
- **Diagrams alignment** — engine-internals and compliance SVGs realigned to canonical product counts (15 ecosystems, 14 + AISVS frameworks, 29 MCP clients, 36 MCP server tools, 26 output formats, 419 test files); OpenClaw / ClawHub framed as distribution surfaces in `integrations/openclaw/README.md`. Issue #2150 closed by #2187.

### Fixed
- **SCIM DELETE removes users from default listing** (P1 IdP-blocker, audit #2196) — `deactivate_user` flips `active=False` and bulk `list_users` now excludes deactivated users, matching Okta/Azure AD deprovisioning expectations. Precise lookups by `userName` / `externalId` / `id` keep finding deactivated users so admins can verify the deactivation landed; `?filter=active eq <bool>` is the new admin-audit primitive. Re-creating a deprovisioned `userName` still 409s.
- **`--allow-insecure-no-auth` no longer silently overridden by SCIM bearer** (P2 audit #2196) — `_enforce_auth_defaults` recognises `AGENT_BOM_SCIM_BEARER_TOKEN` as a valid auth path. When the flag is set together with any auth method, a yellow warning to stderr names the active method instead of pretending the flag disabled auth.
- **Dashboard "Cannot connect" splash distinguishes auth from network errors** (P2 audit #2196) — `ApiOfflineState` takes a `kind: "network" | "auth" | "forbidden"` prop; pages classify thrown errors via `ApiAuthError` / `ApiForbiddenError`. Auth/forbidden cases get distinct copy ("Sign in to view the dashboard" / "This account doesn't have access").
- **`POST /v1/auth/keys/{id}/rotate` accepts empty body** (P3 audit #2196) — body now optional; defaults applied silently for missing or `{}` payloads.
- **Strict MCP tool argument contract** (P1 audit #2197) — every registered tool's JSON schema now sets `additionalProperties: false`, and a runtime guard at the tool-manager call boundary rejects calls with unknown argument keys before FastMCP's Pydantic validation silently drops them. Pre-fix, AI agents passing typo args (`Version` capital, `frob`, etc.) got false-clean verdicts on the pre-install gate.
- **Skill trust verdict split into provenance + content axes** (P1 audit #2197) — `TrustAssessmentResult` now carries `provenance_verdict` (signed? install metadata complete? source URL?) and `content_verdict` (behavioural risk signals from the audit) alongside the legacy `verdict`. Pre-fix, three legitimate cybersecurity playbooks were marked `malicious` purely because they were unsigned and lacked a frontmatter `source:` URL despite zero detected risk signals (~80% false-positive rate on real security skill trees).
- **`--self-scan` walks every venv distribution** (P2 audit #2197) — `_build_self_scan_inventory` now uses `importlib.metadata.distributions()` so transitive deps appear in the inventory. Pre-fix, only ~23 declared deps were scanned vs ~66 actually installed.
- **Proxy stderr sandbox warning is single-emission** (P3 audit #2197) — the duplicated `sys.stderr.write(warning)` is dropped; `logger.warning(warning)` is the single source. The structured `mcp_execution_posture` audit event still carries the same posture detail in machine-readable form.

### Documentation
- New `docs/AGENT_FIREWALL.md` — schema reference, gateway integration, proxy fast-path, dashboard overlay, 4-PR roadmap.
- New `docs/DISCOVERY_ENVELOPE.md` — schema reference, locked vocabulary, producers table, API + UI surface, lock-in matrix.

---

## [0.84.6] – 2026-05-02

### Added
- **CLI startup banner** — running `agent-bom` with no subcommand now renders a branded banner with three quick-start commands and a docs pointer (#2181).
- **Verdict-led compact summary** — `agent-bom scan` ends with a one-line posture verdict plus inventory; the previous detailed configuration-posture panel is preserved behind `--verbose` (#2184).
- **Severity-coloured scan closer** — the trailing line now renders a coloured `Scan complete — N critical · N high · …` breakdown instead of a generic finding count (#2181).
- **Findings header label** — when priority filtering hides rows, the table header reports `Findings (X of Y shown · Z hidden)` so the elision is visible (#2181).

### Fixed
- **Severity closer rendered empty on Python 3.13** — `Severity(str, Enum)` `str()` semantics changed; the closer now reads `Severity.value` so the breakdown renders content on every supported Python (#2185).
- **npm SemVer pre-release tag handling** — `compare_version_order` now strips `-canary.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`, etc. before PEP 440 parsing so npm pre-releases no longer fall through to the conservative "affected" verdict (e.g. CVE-2023-46298 false positive on `next@16.2.4-canary.13`) (#2182).
- **Stacked progress lines under interleaved log warnings** — scanner warnings now flow through Rich during the progress block, so spinners stop double-rendering when GHSA/OSV emit warnings mid-scan (#2183).
- **OSV-first GHSA UX** — the "GITHUB_TOKEN not set" / "limited to N unauthenticated lookups" notes are now informational only and no longer surface as scan warnings; OSV mirrors GHSA within ~24h, so the unauthenticated path is the default for typical use and a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is only needed for fresh-CVE turnaround under 24h (#2181).

---

## [0.84.5] – 2026-05-01

### Added
- **MCP package version provenance** — packages now carry canonical `version_source` and `confidence` metadata, structured evidence, version conflicts, and resolved-version timestamps across scanner data, graph/API outputs, SARIF, SBOM formats, attack-flow exports, SVG graph output, and dashboard surfaces.
- **Floating MCP command resolution evidence** — `npx` and `uvx` package detection now upgrades floating commands from low-confidence registry fallback to higher-confidence local tool-cache evidence when downloaded package metadata is available.

### Fixed
- **Focused CLI flag parity** — `agent-bom secrets` and `agent-bom skills scan` now accept `--no-color`, `--log-json`, and `--log-file` consistently with the rest of the CLI.
- **Version provenance evidence redaction** — package-version evidence now sanitizes local package paths before findings are emitted.
- **Skills quiet output** — `agent-bom skills scan --quiet` suppresses extra prose without dropping the findings table.

---

## [0.84.4] – 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Deterministic release registry gate** — tag workflows now verify committed registry freshness and local JSON serialization stability without running live registry syncs against moving external catalogs.
- **Patch release alignment** — bumped release surfaces from the failed `v0.84.3` tag to `v0.84.4` after the registry gate proved the live-sync check was nondeterministic.

---

## [0.84.3] – 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Release docs deployment guard** — GitHub Pages deployment now only runs from `refs/heads/main`, so tag-triggered release builds can verify docs without entering the protected Pages environment.
- **Patch release alignment** — bumped release surfaces from the cancelled `v0.84.2` tag to `v0.84.3` after the tag workflow was cancelled before package publication.

---

## [0.84.2] – 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Release tag gates** — reusable docs builds now skip GitHub Pages deployment when invoked by the tag release workflow with `deploy: false`, preventing protected Pages environments from blocking package publication.
- **MCP registry sync determinism** — all bundled registry writers now share Unicode-preserving JSON serialization, preventing release-gate churn from rewriting capped descriptions between literal `…` and escaped `\u2026`.
- **Bundled registry freshness** — refreshed the committed MCP registry to 658 servers so the strict `sync-all` release gate can pass without weakening freshness checks.

---

## [0.84.1] – 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Gateway auth and GHSA rate-limit hardening** — gateway API-key verification now fails closed on key-store errors, and unauthenticated GHSA enrichment is capped with upfront warnings so CLI/API/dashboard scans do not pause for long GitHub advisory backoff storms.
- **Extension registry safety** — the extension entry-point registry is documented and explicit, keeping plugin-style imports opt-in instead of silently importing installed package code during security scans.
- **CLI documentation and exit-code alignment** — grouped CLI docs now match the 30+ command surface, usage errors consistently return exit code 2, and release checks guard future CLI reference drift.
- **Graph export parity** — CLI Cytoscape, Graph HTML, Mermaid, GraphML, Cypher, and API graph paths now surface conservative credential → tool `reaches_tool` evidence consistently.
- **Dashboard scan polling** — the scan detail UI now polls a lightweight status endpoint during async scans and fetches the full result only once at completion, avoiding repeated multi-MB `/v1/scan/{id}` payloads.
- **CLI error contracts** — listener ports now reject privileged or invalid values before socket bind, and malformed inventory, VEX, policy, and ignore files fail loudly with actionable parser messages instead of raw tracebacks or silent skips.
- **Pre-release output polish** — clean scans now describe config-posture gaps without contradicting `SECURITY POSTURE: CLEAN`, project-scoped agents render with human-readable labels, and CSV inventory ingestion logs skipped empty package rows.
- **Delta gate artifact consistency** — delta-mode filtering now happens before report rendering so JSON/SARIF artifacts and CI exit gates reflect the same new-only finding set.
- **UI E2E production parity** — Playwright now runs against a staged standalone bundle that mirrors the container runtime, preventing hydration checks from passing only in dev mode.
- **Release registry freshness** — the bundled MCP registry is refreshed for the patch release, release gates now enforce freshness before tagging, and registry descriptions are capped at 100 characters across sync paths to protect catalog/UI consumers.

---

## [0.84.0] – 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Graph capability reachability** — graph construction now emits `EXPLOITABLE_VIA` edges from affected packages/vulnerabilities to reachable MCP tool capability nodes, closing the package → MCP server → tool → agent attack-path chain for graph consumers.
- **Cloud discovery and ingest skills** — bundled skills now cover Azure, GCP, Snowflake, and pushed-inventory ingest workflows alongside the existing AWS discovery path, with the same guardrail contract, provenance requirements, and read-only defaults.
- **MCP server resources, prompts, and capability metadata** — the server card now advertises 36 read-only tools, 6 resources, 6 workflow prompts, and machine-readable capability classes so agents can choose the right workflow without guessing.

### Changed
- **Human reports and graph risk state** — Markdown, HTML, compact console output, and graph nodes now render unified non-CVE findings such as MCP blocklist hits with matching severity, evidence, remediation, and blocked/warning state.
- **Snowflake and self-hosted deployment path** — Snowflake POV docs, EKS deployment profile, BYO Postgres guidance, and deployment navigation were tightened around the current operator-pull and customer-managed data-store model.
- **MCP documentation and metrics alignment** — MCP docs, server-card descriptions, product metrics, Glama/MCP registry manifests, Docker/Helm references, OpenClaw skill metadata, and README release refs now align to the v0.84.0 surface.

### Fixed
- **Bundled skill contract enforcement** — skill guardrail metadata is now regression-tested so new skills must declare credential handling, data flow, file access, network endpoints, invocation policy, and verification posture.
- **Posture headline calibration** — compact output no longer pairs high/critical policy findings with a misleading strong/clean posture headline.
- **Release-surface drift** — package metadata, Helm chart/app versions, image pins, registry manifests, skill versions, and verification docs were bumped together for the v0.84.0 release.

---

## [0.83.4] – 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Snowflake scope-zero operator-pull adapter** — Snowflake now joins AWS, Azure, and GCP as a first-class operator-pushed inventory path, letting teams collect Cortex/Snowpark/Snowflake AI inventory inside their own boundary and explicitly decide whether to hand the canonical JSON to agent-bom for findings, graph, policy, and exports.
- **MCP registry freshness gate** — `agent-bom registry status` now reports stale/never-synced registry state with `needs_refresh` and `recommended_action`, and `--fail-on-stale` gives release, demo, and CI pipelines a hard gate for bundled MCP intelligence freshness.

### Changed
- **Pre-pilot proxy/gateway hardening** — SSE proxy policy checks now match stdio/gateway policy scope, gateway upstream handling has bounded resilience, and remote runtime HTTP mode requires explicit auth unless an operator opts into insecure local behavior.
- **Self-hosted deployment contract** — Helm and deployment docs now state the BYO Postgres contract clearly, including the expected `AGENT_BOM_POSTGRES_URL` secret shape for production profiles.
- **Fleet and scanner state isolation** — fleet graph nodes preserve endpoint identity for same-named agents across devices, and local database scan preference is threaded through `ScanOptions` instead of shared module state.

### Fixed
- **Discovery provenance in exports and UI** — SARIF, OCSF, CycloneDX, and dashboard trust surfaces now retain sanitized discovery provenance, permissions-used, and scan-mode context so auditor-facing outputs match JSON/API evidence.
- **Release/readiness alignment** — README, site docs, OpenClaw skills, Glama/MCP registry manifests, Docker/Helm references, and package metadata are aligned for the v0.83.4 release surface.

---

## [0.83.3] – 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Wheel inventory schema packaging** — `inventory.schema.json` now ships inside the installed `agent_bom` package, so PyPI users can run `agent-bom agents --inventory ...`, operator-pull adapters, and skill-mediated inventory flows without a source checkout.
- **Inventory error exits** — missing inventory schema errors are now surfaced as explicit `--inventory` parameter failures with exit code 2 instead of falling through generic CLI handling.
- **Interactive GHSA checks** — unauthenticated single-package GHSA rate-limit responses now fail fast instead of pausing for the fleet-scan backoff window, while multi-package scans preserve the bounded retry behavior.

### CI
- **Wheel content guard** — PR and release package builds now fail if required JSON schema package data is missing from the wheel.

---

## [0.83.2] – 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Release gate determinism** — the tag publish workflow now uses `pip-audit` as the hard Python dependency release gate and keeps `agent-bom` self-scan SARIF as bounded evidence without opportunistic DB refresh, preventing third-party enrichment drift from cancelling a release after the build and container gates have already passed.

---

## [0.83.1] – 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Release workflow stability** — reusable docs deployment now honors `deploy: false` when invoked by the release workflow, preventing a tag release from trying to deploy GitHub Pages as part of package publishing.
- **Post-merge SAST time budget** — post-merge source analysis now uses the bounded `agent-bom code` analyzer and converts its JSON to SARIF, preserving Security tab upload coverage without running the broad scan pipeline.

---

## [0.83.0] – 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Scope-zero discovery and pushed inventory workflows** — operator-pull adapters now let teams collect AWS, Azure, and GCP inventory inside their own boundary, emit canonical inventory JSON, and choose whether to stop at the file boundary or explicitly hand the inventory to `agent-bom agents --inventory` for findings, graph, policy, and exports.
- **Agentic skill surfaces** — bundled AWS discovery and vulnerability-intelligence skills define standalone, guardrailed workflows for AI-agent users. Skills default to explain/discover/check modes and make any scan, push, or export handoff explicit.
- **Discovery provider contracts** — `/v1/discovery/providers` and the extension registry contract now describe provider scan modes, permissions used, network boundaries, redaction posture, and scope-zero extension modes without loading third-party provider code by default.
- **End-to-end discovery provenance** — inventory, packages, findings, graph exports, SARIF, UI surfaces, and pushed results now preserve discovery provenance, mapping method, confidence, lifecycle fields, cloud origin, permissions used, and reachability context through the canonical model.
- **Extension entry-point registries** — cloud providers, connectors, and inventory parsers now have opt-in entry-point registry foundations for plugins and SDK-built integrations while preserving built-in behavior when extension loading is disabled.

### Changed
- **Cloud discovery normalization** — AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks, Snowflake, CoreWeave, Nebius, Hugging Face, OpenAI, W&B, and MLflow assets now use service/resource-type-aware `cloud_origin` envelopes, lifecycle fields, status, canonical package PURLs, and sanitized warning boundaries.
- **Scanner and ingestion robustness** — scanner options are isolated per scan, AWS provider discovery runs service collectors in parallel, external scanner ingestion preserves advisory metadata, and cross-environment correlation is bucketed by account/project context for fleet-scale scans.
- **Agentic architecture documentation** — docs now explain the product/skill/MCP layering, secure handoff modes, subagent delegation boundaries, and how teams can use agent-bom locally, in CI, self-hosted, cloud-read-only, pushed inventory, or through AI-agent workflows.

### Security
- **Launch metadata redaction** — MCP launch args, URLs, runtime errors, audit details, graph metadata, SARIF locations, CycloneDX properties, AI prompts, pushed results, and UI fallbacks are sanitized before storage, export, display, or prompt construction.
- **MCP intelligence and gates** — MCP intelligence now carries confidence, source, recommendation, references, and remediation metadata; non-CVE findings are rendered in compact output, SARIF, graph/API surfaces, and `--fail-on-severity` gates.
- **Proxy and scanner hardening** — proxy audit hash chains use a stable path-derived lock, server-to-client JSON-RPC reads are bounded, Docker/Podman MCP image commands scan through the image inventory path or fail closed, registry fallback matching is boundary-aware, and GHSA advisory lookups paginate with rate-limit handling.

### Fixed
- **GitHub Pages deployment** — docs deploy on pushes by default again, preventing stale Pages output after successful docs builds.
- **PR gate SARIF contract** — AppSec PR-gate SARIF output now uses real self-scan output and fails fast when focused modes cannot produce valid SARIF.
- **Stranded PR handling** — retrigger automation and lockfile-normalization CI were hardened to reduce frozen PRs caused by GitHub's token anti-loop behavior.

---

## [0.82.3] – 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Reachability-aware blast radius** — the graph-walk dependency-reach engine that shipped in v0.82.0 is now wired into `BlastRadius` scoring and the dashboard. New `BlastRadius.graph_reachable` / `graph_min_hop_distance` / `graph_reachable_from_agents` fields are populated by `agent_bom.graph.blast_reach.apply_dependency_reachability_to_blast_radii` during the analysis phase of every scan; `calculate_risk_score()` applies a small contextual nudge (+0.5 reachable, −0.5 unreachable, env-overridable via `AGENT_BOM_RISK_REACHABLE_BOOST` / `AGENT_BOM_RISK_UNREACHABLE_PENALTY`) so reachable findings rise above otherwise-equivalent unreachable ones in triage. The vulns dashboard renders a "Reachable · N hops" / "Unreachable" badge next to KEV. Engine failures degrade to a no-op so a graph bug never breaks the scan path. Closes the v0.82.2 honest-gap on engine-vs-surfacing (#2040).
- **KEDA-driven autoscaling on the control-plane API tier** — new `controlplane-api-keda-scaledobject.yaml` Helm template + `examples/eks-keda-values.yaml` production preset. Three default Prometheus triggers tuned to bursty scanner workloads: rate-limit pressure, p99 latency, and the new `agent_bom_scan_jobs_active` gauge. The static CPU/memory HPA is suppressed when KEDA is enabled so two HPAs never fight over the same Deployment. Closes the EKS scoring audit's "HPA custom metrics not wired" gap (#2035, #2037).
- **`agent_bom_scan_jobs_active` Prometheus gauge** — first-class queue-depth gauge bumped at `enqueue_scan_job` and decremented in `_run_scan_sync`'s `finally` block. Floored at zero so an instrumentation gap absorbs gracefully rather than producing a negative scrape. Records `record_scan_completion(status)` at the same site, wiring up the previously-orphaned counter (#2037).
- **Clustered Postgres scale evidence harness** — `scripts/run_postgres_scale_evidence.py` drives the real `agent_bom.api.postgres_*` modules at increasing scale (audit append, job put/get) with `--replicas N` for `ProcessPoolExecutor` fan-out so the run captures pool contention + advisory-lock cost, not just single-process throughput. New `.github/workflows/postgres-scale-evidence.yml` runs it manually + weekly against a `postgres:16-alpine` service container and uploads JSON evidence as a 90-day artifact. PRs do NOT run it — too slow and tuning-sensitive to gate on. Closes the v0.82.2 SLO doc's "no published clustered Postgres scale benchmark" gap (#2038).
- **Auto-retrigger workflow for stranded PRs** — `.github/workflows/auto-retrigger-stranded.yml` runs `scripts/retrigger_stranded_pr.sh` on a `*/5 * * * *` cron against every open non-draft PR whose current head SHA has zero `Lint and Type Check` runs. Permanently neutralises the GITHUB_TOKEN-authored "Update branch" anti-loop suppression that intermittently stranded #1996, #2030, #2031, #2034, #2035 in this release cycle (#2036).
- **Per-framework compliance coverage table** — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § Coverage per framework` publishes the bundled-control counts vs. source-standard size for all 14 frameworks. README + `SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` + `MCP_SECURITY_MODEL.md` + `MCP_ERROR_CODES.md` link to it. Closes the v0.82.2 honest-gap on compliance breadth (#2032).
- **Two-image deployment guidance** — new `docs/ENTERPRISE_DEPLOYMENT.md § Container images — do I need both?` section with verifiable code refs (`server.py:685-708` mounts `ui_dist/`, `pyproject.toml:189` ships `ui_dist/**` as wheel package data). Single-host pilots only need `agentbom/agent-bom`; the second image is for Kubernetes deployments that scale / restrict / ingress the UI tier independently (#2039).
- **Merge-queue runbook + helper script** — `docs/operations/CI_RUNBOOK.md § Permanent fix options` now documents the supported UI-only path for enabling merge queue, with `scripts/enable_merge_queue.sh --check` to inspect current ruleset state (#2034).

### Changed
- **UI TypeScript is now strict on `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`** — closes the long-running tracking issue #1967. Every array/Record index access yields `T | undefined` and every `?:` field is treated as "absent OR T". 60 violations fixed across the UI tree, mostly via type widening at internal boundaries plus conditional-spread for 3rd-party React-Flow / Recharts integrations. ESLint already enforced `no-floating-promises` and `no-explicit-any` as `error`; `lightningcss` was already in `devDependencies`; UI version was already lockstep with the platform release process (#2030, #2033).
- **Mypy strict phasing — four more API store modules** — `fleet_store`, `idempotency_store`, `schedule_store`, `scim_store` added to the per-module strict override list in `pyproject.toml`. Generic `dict` annotations widened to `dict[str, Any]`, `_local.conn` returns surfaced as concrete `sqlite3.Connection`, pydantic `model_validate_json` and platform-invariant helpers wrapped to satisfy `warn_return_any` under `--follow-imports=skip`. Refs #1969 (#2031).

---

## [0.82.2] – 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **UI image multi-arch publish** — `ui/Dockerfile` hard-pinned `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu@1.32.0`, which broke the arm64 leg of the v0.82.1 release pipeline's `Publish UI image` job (`docker buildx --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) with `EBADPLATFORM`. The fix consumes the `TARGETARCH` build arg buildx already injects and installs the matching prebuilt only (`lightningcss-linux-arm64-gnu` for arm64, `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu` for amd64). v0.82.1 published the Python package, main API/CLI image, Helm chart, Sigstore signature, SLSA provenance, and CycloneDX SBOM successfully; only the standalone dashboard UI image at `agentbom/agent-bom-ui:0.82.x` was missing. v0.82.2 republishes that image for both architectures (#2025).

---

## [0.82.1] – 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Dashboard build under `output: "export"`** — `ui/app/graph/page.tsx` was using `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, which is incompatible with Next 16's static export and aborted the v0.82.0 release pipeline at the Build/dashboard step (PyPI + Docker Hub publish jobs were skipped). Replaced with `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })`, the standard pattern for client-only components (`@xyflow/react` needs DOM) inside a static export. Re-enables the release pipeline; v0.82.0 stayed a no-op tag with no published artifacts.

---

## [0.82.0] – 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Graph-walk dependency reachability engine** — new `agent_bom.graph.compute_dependency_reach` (in `src/agent_bom/graph/dependency_reach.py`) runs BFS from every agent node along `USES` / `DEPENDS_ON` / `CONTAINS` / `PROVIDES_TOOL` edges and reports per-package `min_hop_distance` + `reachable_from` plus per-vulnerability summaries. **Engine half only.** Surfacing reach in blast-radius scoring and the dashboard follows in a separate PR; this release does not change scoring behaviour. Closes the engine half of #1896 (#2009).
- **JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) generated from API Pydantic models** — `scripts/generate_v1_schemas.py` walks every public model in `agent_bom.api.models`, emits `docs/schemas/v1/<Model>.json` per model plus an `index.json` manifest. CI gates the drift via `--check`. SDK consumers can codegen against the published surface. Closes #1963 (#2007).
- **Row-virtualized agent list pages** — `ui/app/agents/page.tsx` configured + installed agent cards now render through `@tanstack/react-virtual`'s `useVirtualizer` with `measureElement` for variable-height rows. Enterprise estates with thousands of agents no longer render every card flat. Vitest covers the windowing math. Refs #1955 — agents half closed; vulns table flat path is already paginated, grouped path windowing tracked separately (#2006).
- **Cross-environment correlation framework + AWS Bedrock matcher** — local agents and cloud-discovered Bedrock runtimes are now matched on the strict triplet of cloud account ID + region + model ID. Strong matches emit `CORRELATES_WITH` graph edges; partial matches stay visible as `POSSIBLY_CORRELATES_WITH` with a `matched_signals` evidence list so reviewers can see candidates without the platform conflating them. Phase 1 of #1892; Phase 2 (Azure OpenAI / Functions, #1992) and Phase 3 (GCP Vertex / Cloud Run, #1993) plug into the same dispatch.
- **Azure OpenAI cross-environment matcher** — extends the cross-environment correlation framework to Azure OpenAI deployments. Strict triplet is subscription ID + Cognitive Services account name + deployment name; explicit `OPENAI_API_TYPE=open_ai` disqualifies the agent so an Azure-shaped match never fires for public-OpenAI clients. Cloud discovery for Azure OpenAI now emits a normalized `cloud_origin` envelope so the matcher has structured identity to compare against. Phase 2 of #1892 (#1992).
- **GCP Vertex AI cross-environment matcher** — extends the cross-environment correlation framework to GCP Vertex endpoints. Strict triplet is project ID + location + endpoint ID; the project-ID format gate rejects arbitrary strings (e.g. "test", emails) from counting as a project match. The endpoint env value is also accepted as a full Vertex resource path so a single IaC-supplied identifier surfaces all three signals. Phase 3 of #1892 (#1993).
- **Cloud origin lineage in the unified graph** — agents discovered with cloud metadata now promote `cloud_principal`, `cloud_resource`, and direct principal→agent edges so single-hop reachability queries no longer have to traverse the intermediate cloud_resource node.
- **GPU and k8s GPU promotion** — GPU containers and Kubernetes GPU clusters now flow into the unified graph alongside the rest of the inventory.
- **Static multi-agent topology edges** — framework-level agent topology is now materialized as graph edges so reviewers can see which agents delegate to which.
- **System prompt and MCP prompt inventory** — system prompts and MCP server prompts are now captured as policy evidence and surfaced through the standard inventory paths.
- **AI observability SDK inventory** — observability SDKs are detected and recorded as managed inventory.
- **MCP stable error envelope** — MCP responses now carry stable `code` / `category` / `details` / `schema_version` fields and a published API parity matrix so SDK consumers can branch on machine-readable errors.
- **Vanilla EKS production preset** — `deploy/helm/agent-bom/examples/eks-vanilla-values.yaml` ships a production-shaped preset for self-hosted EKS rollouts.
- **Customer secret rotation adapter evidence** — secret rotation adapters now emit deterministic evidence so operators can prove a managed key was rotated by their KMS, not the platform.
- **Native control-plane mTLS fallback** — the API can terminate mTLS itself when no mesh or front proxy is available, with a posture surface on `/v1/auth/policy`.
- **Frontend API error taxonomy + GET caching/dedup** — the dashboard API client now exposes a typed error taxonomy and dedupes/caches GET requests with prefix-scoped invalidation.
- **Columnar CIS benchmark trend aggregation** — CIS results persist into a fact table dimensioned by cloud × section × status × severity × time bucket, with a new `/v1/compliance/cis/trends` endpoint and AWS/Azure/GCP cross-cloud fixtures so operators can graph drift over time. Closes #1832 (#2013).

### Changed
- **Tenant quota enforcement is now atomic per tenant** — new `tenant_quota_guard(tenant_id, *checks)` context manager in `agent_bom.api.tenant_quota` holds a per-tenant `threading.Lock` (single-process atomicity) **and**, when `AGENT_BOM_POSTGRES_URL` is set, a session-scoped `pg_advisory_lock` keyed on `sha256(tenant_id)` for cross-replica atomicity. Wraps the (check + insert) pair in `scan`, `schedules`, `observability/push`, `scheduler-trigger`, and `fleet-sync` route handlers so concurrent requests serialise per tenant and the second caller sees the first caller's row in its check (audit-4 #2008 + audit-5 PR-B #2011).
- **Workflow timeout coverage** — every job in `.github/workflows/` now declares `timeout-minutes`, including reusable-workflow callers (`uses:`) which were silently inheriting the 360-minute GitHub default. New `scripts/check_workflow_timeouts.py` gates drift in CI (#2008, #2010).
- **Dependabot UI lockfile workflow** — `npm run lock:normalize` was replaced with the inline `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` so a Dependabot branch can't redefine the script under the privileged `pull_request_target` token.
- **Centralised tenant resolution for CLI and MCP** — CLI and MCP entry points now resolve tenant id through one shared helper instead of per-surface ad-hoc logic.
- **Backpressure posture surfaced on `/v1/auth/policy`** — the operator policy endpoint now reports adaptive backpressure state (paths, p99, retry-after) alongside the auth and rate-limit posture.
- **CSP source-of-truth centralised** — `ui/next.config.ts` and `ui/vercel.json` now share one CSP definition; `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` is temporarily restored pending the hash-pinning collector.
- **Docker compose deployment** — platform compose files now use Docker secrets for Postgres credentials and align healthchecks across services.
- **Docker base alignment** — runtime images now use LTS base versions and the build pipeline gates on the Glama and image-policy checks.
- **Floating reference policy** — references to mutable upstream tags are now disallowed in build inputs by automated policy.
- **Postgres sizing guidance + weekly scale-evidence regen** — `docs/perf/` documents `pg_size_pretty` sizing for 1k/5k/10k estates and a scheduled CI run keeps `docs/perf/results/` fresh.
- **Generated `AGENT_BOM_*` env reference** — the env-var reference is now generated from `config.py` and CI fails if the doc drifts from the source.

### Fixed
- **Graph `add_edge` no longer drops second-add evidence on dedup** — when the builder adds the package-path edge first and the blast-radius edge second for the same `(source, target, relationship)`, the second edge's `evidence` dict (cvss, epss, kev, attack tags) is now merged into the kept edge instead of being silently discarded. Kept side wins on key conflicts so existing order-of-arrival semantics for shared keys are preserved (audit-5 PR-A #2010).
- **`_resolve_affected_server_ids` intersection collapse is now logged** — the narrow-by-server / narrow-by-agent intersections silently emptied when the named filter and the package-path candidates were disjoint. A debug log now surfaces report inconsistency to operator logs without changing the production narrow-by-all-filters semantics (audit-5 PR-A #2010).
- **SAML relay-state cleanup runs on issue too** — `_new_saml_relay_state()` previously inserted into `_SAML_RELAY_STATES` but never swept expired entries, letting an attacker who issued nonces but never completed the SAML round trip grow the in-memory map unbounded. Sweep on issue too (audit-5 PR-A #2010).
- **`release.yml` docs-site reusable caller missed timeout** — the audit-4 sweep added `timeout-minutes` to 29 jobs but skipped `docs-site` because the gate's `_is_reusable_caller()` helper returned `True` for any job with `uses:`. Reusable callers actually need their own timeout (the called workflow's per-job timeouts don't bound the caller; GitHub's default is 360 minutes). Gate fixed + `docs-site` now declares `timeout-minutes: 20` (audit-5 PR-A #2010).
- **Release and post-merge job timeouts** — every release-pipeline and post-merge-self-scan job now has an explicit `timeout-minutes`; runaway jobs no longer hold scarce runners.
- **Container rescan checkout pinned to v6** — the daily image rescan now uses a v6-pinned `actions/checkout` SHA aligned with the rest of the pipeline.
- **main-ui-smoke boot script** — the standalone container boot script now assembles the `.next/static` tree explicitly (`rm`/`mkdir`/`cp -a`) so a missing source dir no longer aborts the smoke under `set -e`.
- **Frontend contract hygiene** — closed frontend contract gaps surfaced by the post-v0.81.3 audit.
- **Audit contract runtime gaps** — closed runtime gaps in audit-log integrity, signing, and lifecycle posture surfaced by the post-v0.81.3 audit.
- **Adaptive backpressure retry-after jitter** — retry-after now uses multiplicative jitter so colocated callers don't all retry on the same boundary at base ≈ 1s.
- **`scripts/retrigger_stranded_pr.sh` race** — the close→reopen gap now polls the GitHub API until the PR's state is observably `closed` before issuing the reopen call (was a fixed `sleep 2`). Prevents the reopen from racing against propagation and silently no-opping.
- **`release.yml` docs-site invalid `timeout-minutes` on reusable caller** — GitHub Actions rejects `timeout-minutes` on a job whose body is `uses: ./.github/workflows/...`; the field made `release.yml` fail validation on every push to main. Removed the field from the `docs-site` caller and reverted `_is_reusable_caller()` in `scripts/check_workflow_timeouts.py` so the gate skips reusable callers (with a `Why:` comment so the next contributor doesn't re-add the broken field) (#2016).
- **`scripts/run_scale_evidence.py` ValueError on outside-ROOT `--output`** — `args.output.relative_to(ROOT)` raised when the operator passed an absolute path outside the repo. Wrapped in `try/except` with a fallback to the absolute path (#2016).
- **Vulnerability table grouped-view windowing** — the grouped-by-package and grouped-by-source paths in `ui/app/vulns/page.tsx` now cap each group at `PAGE_SIZE` with an overflow notice, matching the flat-mode windowing already in place. Closes the vulns half of #1955 (#2015).

### Security
- **Six missing UI relationship colors + Vitest invariant** — `RELATIONSHIP_COLOR_MAP` in `ui/lib/graph-schema.ts` was missing `REMEDIATES`, `TRIGGERS`, `MANAGES`, `OWNS`, `PART_OF`, `MEMBER_OF`. `MANAGES` was the freshest gap — the cloud_principal → agent edge added in #1996 was rendering without colour. New `ui/tests/graph-schema-color-invariant.test.ts` walks every `RelationshipType` value and fails when any is missing from the colour map (audit-4 #2008).
- **`shutil.which()` → absolute path TOCTOU** — `proxy_sandbox.resolve_container_runtime` and `filesystem._scan_archive` now resolve the binary via `shutil.which` once and pass the absolute path through to `subprocess`, closing the small PATH-substitution window between resolve and exec (audit-4 #2008).
- **`O_NOFOLLOW` on skill-bundle hash read** — `skill_bundles._sha256_file` now opens with `os.O_RDONLY | os.O_NOFOLLOW` so the kernel itself rejects a symlinked leaf, closing the gap between the prior symlink check and the read (audit-4 #2008).
- **Auth attempt counter is clustered-mode visible** — `_check_auth_session_rate_limit` emits a one-shot WARNING log on first use whenever clustered control-plane mode is detected (`AGENT_BOM_POSTGRES_URL` or `AGENT_BOM_REQUIRE_SHARED_RATE_LIMIT`), so operators see the cross-replica multiplier on the in-process counter. PR-A introduced the warning (audit-5 PR-A #2010); the Postgres-backed counter that fully closes the gap landed in PR-C #2012 (see entry below).
- **Cluster-safe shared auth state** — auth session attempt counters and revoked session nonces now persist through `agent_bom.api.shared_auth_state`, which auto-selects an `InMemoryAuthState` backend by default and a `PostgresAuthState` backend when `AGENT_BOM_POSTGRES_URL` is set. Closes the cross-replica visibility gap that PR-A only warned on; SQL is parameterised through module-level constants to keep the surface Bandit-clean (audit-5 PR-C #2012).
- **Body-drain middleware slowloris floor** — `MaxBodySizeMiddleware` now enforces a configurable minimum throughput (`AGENT_BOM_BODY_MIN_BPS`, default 256 B/s) on request-body reads so a slow client can no longer hold a worker indefinitely while staying under the size cap (audit-5 PR-C #2012).
- **Auth middleware hardening** — header normalisation, exempt-path startup assertions, and tightened trust-proxy posture across the auth middleware stack.
- **Tenant RLS bypass guard now under test** — the `APIKeyMiddleware` defence-in-depth check that rejects any request still inside an active `bypass_tenant_rls()` context is now covered by two regression tests (`tests/test_api_hardening.py`). Locks the guard so a future refactor cannot quietly drop it.
- **MCP sandbox `image_pin_policy` posture surfaced** — `/v1/auth/policy` now reports the deployment-wide default and recommends `enforce` for production.
- **Cross-parser dedup proofs + Postgres RLS red-team test for `scan_jobs`** — added structural and runtime guards proving a session bound to tenant B cannot read tenant A `scan_jobs` rows under a non-superuser role.
- **Dependabot UI lockfile workflow no longer trusts the PR `scripts.lock:normalize` entry** — replaces the `npm run lock:normalize` step with an inline `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` so a Dependabot branch can't redefine the script under a privileged `pull_request_target` token.

### Internal
- **Tracked Finder duplicate artifacts blocked** — CI now refuses to merge tracked macOS Finder duplicate files (e.g. `… 2.md`).
- **Real Postgres integration contract** — `tests/test_postgres_integration.py` now exercises real Postgres for job, audit, and RLS contracts.
- **Stricter mypy on four more API modules** — `agent_bom.api.scim`, `agent_bom.api.storage_schema`, `agent_bom.api.tenant_quota_store`, `agent_bom.api.tracing` now run under the per-module strict overrides (`disallow_untyped_defs`, `disallow_incomplete_defs`, `warn_return_any`, `warn_unused_ignores`). Phase 3 of #1969 (#2003).
- **UI `lib/api.ts` presentation helpers extracted** — `severityColor`, `severityDot`, `formatDate`, `isConfigured` moved to `ui/lib/api-format.ts` and re-exported from `lib/api.ts` so 50+ caller imports keep working unchanged. First step toward the broader decomposition tracked in #1965 (#2004).
- **Pending-digest CI gate now ages markers out at 24h** — `scripts/check_docker_base_policy.py` reads each `# pending-digest` marker's `git blame --porcelain` committer-time and fails when older than `PENDING_DIGEST_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (default 86400). Stops the marker from quietly outstaying its purpose if dependabot's docker job misses a bump (audit-3 #2005).
- **`/v1/posture/backpressure` explicit `_ROLE_RULES` entry** — narrower entries listed before broad `/v1/posture` for grep/audit clarity. Behaviour unchanged (audit-3 #2005).
- **`_clean_graph_part` fallback chain for `service`** — provider's two-source fallback chain now also applies to service (recovers `<provider>-<service>` segment from `agent_dict.source`); `resource_type` keeps the literal placeholder (audit-3 #2005).
- **README cloud CSP inventory** — README header now enumerates AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, Databricks, CoreWeave, Nebius next to "cloud" (audit-3 #2005).
- **Tenant RLS bypass guard tests** — `APIKeyMiddleware`'s defence-in-depth check that rejects requests entering with `bypass_tenant_rls()` still active is now under regression coverage in `tests/test_api_hardening.py` so a future refactor can't quietly drop the guard (audit-2 #2002).
- **`scripts/retrigger_stranded_pr.sh` close→reopen race** — now polls the GitHub API until the PR's state is observably `closed` before issuing the reopen call (was a fixed `sleep 2`). Prevents the reopen from racing against propagation and silently no-opping (audit-2 #2002).
- **Hermetic Python scanner surfaced in docs** — README and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` now name the single-language stack (CLI / FastAPI / MCP / scanners / enrichment / blast / IaC / CIS in one Python interpreter, native dpkg/RPM disk-image parsers, `syft` opt-in tar-archive fallback only) along with the honest tradeoffs (slower at huge fanouts, higher per-package memory) (#2015).
- **mypy strict overrides expanded to nine more modules** — `agent_bom.api.compliance_signing`, `dashboard_csp`, `metrics`, `scim`, `storage_schema`, `tenant_quota_store`, `tracing`, plus `agent_bom.backpressure` and `agent_bom.proxy_sandbox` now run under `disallow_untyped_defs` / `disallow_incomplete_defs` / `warn_return_any` / `warn_unused_ignores`. Phase 3 of #1969 (#2015).
- **`docs.yml` Python pin aligned to 3.11** — the docs-build job now uses the same Python the rest of the workflows do, removing a 3.12 outlier from the matrix.

---

## [0.81.3] – 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **Deployment and runtime guidance** — the README, self-hosted EKS guide, endpoint fleet guide, and proxy-vs-gateway-vs-fleet guide now surface the current graph scale boundary, recommended self-hosted defaults, runtime deployment matrix, and discovery-confidence boundaries where operators actually make rollout decisions.

### Fixed
- **Graph overview regression guardrail** — the graph API test suite now locks the default `/v1/graph` overview path to the store-backed `page_nodes` / `edges_for_node_ids` / `snapshot_stats` flow so filtered paging cannot silently fall back to full `load_graph()` materialization.
- **Docker Hub release sync** — the release workflow now uses a Docker Hub short description that stays under the registry API byte limit, preventing the `Publish to Docker Hub` job from failing after image push.

---

## [0.81.2] – 2026-04-23

### Added
- **UI session and capability contract** — `/v1/auth/me` now exposes authenticated actor, tenant, backend role, UI-facing capability summaries, and explicit `can_see` / `can_do` guidance so the browser shell can reflect the real backend auth model instead of inferring permissions ad hoc.
- **Endpoint enrollment identity contract** — managed endpoint onboarding bundles now emit stable `source_id`, `enrollment_name`, owner, environment, tag, and MDM metadata so fleet inventory can preserve one explicit endpoint identity model across Jamf, Intune, Kandji, and local rollout paths.

### Changed
- **Release-managed version surfaces** — the bump/check scripts now manage compose and runtime version pins as first-class release surfaces so image/version drift fails fast in CI instead of leaking into post-tag cleanup.
- **Snowflake schedule parity** — warehouse-native deployments now persist recurring scan schedules in Snowflake and wire `/v1/schedules*` through the same backend-selection path as jobs, fleet, and gateway policy stores.
- **Snowflake exception parity** — exception workflows now persist through the Snowflake backend too, extending the warehouse-native control-plane boundary without overclaiming full Postgres parity.
- **Snowflake tenant-scoped store lookups** — job, fleet, schedule, and exception lookups/deletes now carry tenant scope into the Snowflake store layer instead of relying only on post-hoc route checks, keeping the warehouse path aligned with the platform’s defense-in-depth tenant model.
- **Graph search and slice filtering** — the control plane now uses indexed graph-node search paths with server-side entity, severity, compliance-prefix, and data-source filters so larger tenant snapshots do not fall back to broad client-side graph scans.
- **Graph overview pagination** — the default `/v1/graph` overview path now pages nodes and page-local edges from the store instead of materializing whole snapshots in memory before pagination.
- **Endpoint onboarding bundles** — managed endpoint rollout bundles now carry a machine-readable enrollment manifest plus optional stable fleet `source_id` wiring so Jamf, Intune, and Kandji pushes can keep one explicit endpoint identity contract instead of only raw install scripts.
- **Deployment and product framing** — README, deployment docs, self-hosted diagrams, trust-boundary docs, and Snowflake-parity guidance now align around `AI supply chain and infrastructure`, one obvious pilot path, one obvious production path, and explicit self-hosted vs MSSP boundaries.
- **MCP server modularization** — the monolith split continued with extracted shared scan pipeline, resource/prompt catalog, FastMCP bootstrap helpers, and runtime catalog tool registration while keeping `create_mcp_server()` behavior and public imports stable.

### Fixed
- **Shield concurrency and API rate limiting** — shield now reuses a bounded async bridge instead of spinning up unbounded executor paths, and the in-memory API rate limiter is explicitly thread-safe.
- **Platform record invariants** — persisted fleet and MCP observation records now normalize tenant identity and UTC ISO-8601 timestamps consistently on read/write so graph, fleet, runtime, and audit correlation work from the same canonical model.
- **Audit and graph query hardening** — exception approval/revocation no longer allow actor spoofing, graph routes move sync store calls off the event loop, SQLite graph search falls back cleanly when FTS `MATCH` expressions error, and audit replay rejects malformed short HMAC values instead of truncating them into a false compare.

### Security
- **Gateway hardening** — scoped API keys are now enforced on the routes that already advertise scoped auth behavior, and gateway 404 responses no longer leak tenant-specific upstream details.
- **Runtime monitor defaults** — the optional monitor DaemonSet now uses a dedicated service-account path, disables automounted service-account tokens, and is documented as an explicit zero-trust, off-by-default runtime surface rather than an assumed deployment requirement.

---

## [0.81.1] – 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Inventory-first MCP visibility** — the control plane now surfaces MCP command/URL, auth mode, credential-backed configuration, fleet timing, and provenance across scans, fleet sync, gateway discovery, and persisted observations instead of forcing operators to infer source context from summary badges.
- **Operator feedback surface** — the shipped UI now includes in-product `Share feedback` and `Report bug` entry points with a copyable support bundle instead of relying on out-of-band issue filing alone.
- **Runtime rollout packaging** — endpoint proxy bundles can now be rendered as `.pkg`, `.msi`, Homebrew, and MDM-oriented rollout assets, and Kubernetes deployments can opt into proxy sidecar auto-injection through the packaged mutating webhook path.

### Changed
- **Self-hosted runtime model clarity** — the product now documents `fleet`, `proxy`, and `gateway` as peer surfaces with explicit deployment/use guidance, tighter EKS rollout docs, clearer entrypoints, and an honest retention/security-lake model that matches the current code and storage backends.
- **Security graph semantics** — the UI and docs now make snapshot identity, scope, timestamps, pagination, node identifiers, and blast-radius semantics explicit so graph investigation scales without inventing a second graph model in the operator workflow.
- **Release-caveat guidance** — graph/load boundaries, screenshot-redaction scope, centralized managed-connection limits, and the contributor workflow around GitHub’s `Update branch` synthetic-head problem are now explicit in the shipped docs instead of living as tribal knowledge.

### Fixed
- **AWS/EKS operator path** — the reference installer now includes preflight checks and post-deploy verification so self-hosted rollout is not "install and guess" anymore.
- **Skill-audit correlation gap** — skill-audit findings now feed the graph instead of landing as an orphan analysis surface outside the main inventory and blast-radius model.
- **Runtime contract coverage** — gateway rate-limit behavior and inbound OCSF normalization now have explicit contract tests instead of relying on indirect coverage only.

### Security
- **Runtime hardening sweep** — middleware RBAC write-route coverage is closed, cached proxy policy bundles are Ed25519-signed and fail closed on mismatch, gateway policies can hot-reload without redeploy, and replay detection now uses a bounded long-window design instead of a short-lived exact-only cache.
- **Deploy-time hardening** — the AWS/EKS rollout path now validates control-plane inputs before install, and packaged runtime operations document policy-signing rotation and cert-manager-backed webhook certificate renewal instead of leaving those as tribal knowledge.

---

## [0.81.0] – 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Hosted control-plane source workflows** — first-class source records and source-linked jobs are now joined by persisted schedule controls on `/sources`, so operators can create recurring runs against real `source_id` records instead of reading static guidance (#1602, #1606).

### Changed
- **Blast-radius scoring semantics** — EPSS percentile tiers now influence blast-radius scoring directly, and the previous 35-point deduction ceiling has been removed so high-reach critical exposure does not flatten into the same score band (#1605).
- **Package lookup hot path** — version parsing is cached and package presence checks are batched, cutting repeated database round-trips on larger scan inventories (#1605).
- **Traceability on hot paths** — the API, graph builder, DB lookup path, and runtime proxy now emit OTEL spans with W3C trace propagation so control-plane and proxy activity share one trace context (#1605).

### Fixed
- **Release-managed surface alignment** — package metadata, Dockerfiles, Helm values, runtime examples, registry manifests, and marketplace-facing version pins now align on `0.81.0` instead of leaving post-release drift for operators to discover manually.

### Security
- **Tenant-scoped control-plane reads** — asset routes now enforce tenant scope directly instead of trusting caller-provided tenant context, closing the highest-risk cross-tenant read gap from the post-release audit (#1603).
- **Fail-closed OIDC and audit integrity** — OIDC discovery now refuses unsafe tenant/JWKS combinations, audit records are chained instead of independently HMACed, and gateway requests validate API keys against control-plane state before relay (#1603).
- **Per-tenant runtime fairness** — scan concurrency and operator policy surfaces now expose tenant-specific quota enforcement instead of relying on one global in-process ceiling (#1605).

---

## [0.80.1] – 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Standalone UI image release path** — the Next.js container build now emits the `.next/standalone` output expected by the published `agent-bom-ui` image, and CI smoke-tests that path before release.
- **Version-surface coherence** — Helm examples, runtime sidecar manifests, release verification docs, and product metrics now align on `0.80.1` so the public release surfaces match the shipped tag.

### Security
- **Tenant and gateway auth hardening** — Postgres-backed API key verification can now resolve non-default tenant keys during auth and gateway relay paths, instead of silently falling back to default-tenant visibility under RLS.

---

## [0.80.0] – 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Control-plane auth for the shipped UI** — OIDC, trusted-proxy browser auth, session API-key fallback, and runtime auth introspection now let the dashboard operate as a real operator surface instead of a same-origin-only shell.
- **Hosted-product source registry baseline** — the API and UI now expose first-class source records, source-linked jobs, and persisted schedule state as the first slice of the hosted control-plane model.
- **Signed release surfaces** — Helm OCI publish, UI image release wiring, and stronger release verification/docs were added to the productized deployment path.

### Changed
- **P0/P1 audit closure** — visual leak detector races, timeout audit gaps, resolver/VEX strictness, ServiceMonitor/operator defaults, CSP documentation, and UI dependency/release guardrails were tightened across the release lane.
- **Deployment docs and diagrams** — self-hosted operator guidance, EKS rollout docs, and enterprise topology explanations were rewritten to match the actual control-plane/runtime split in code.

### Fixed
- **Gateway and runtime audit integrity** — timeout paths now audit correctly, OCR runs once per response instead of once per image block, and the control plane/runtime surfaces agree on the operator deployment contract.
- **UI packaging accuracy** — README and deployment copy now describe the Python image and standalone UI image honestly instead of implying a single bundled live dashboard path.

---

## [0.79.0] – 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Multi-MCP gateway and rollout path** — central `agent-bom gateway serve`, fleet-driven upstream discovery, focused EKS pilot guidance, and deployment-first docs for self-hosted operator environments (#1551, #1552, #1554, #1555, #1560).
- **Visual leak runtime enforcement** — `VisualLeakDetector` is now wired into gateway and proxy protection paths so screenshot and image tool responses can be redacted or blocked as part of the runtime policy surface (#1572, #1575).
- **Bidirectional OTEL product surface** — OTLP export, W3C trace context, `/v1/traces` ingest, and runtime OTEL evidence are now called out as first-class operator capabilities in the shipped product surfaces (#1583).

### Changed
- **Tenant-native persistence and parity** — fleet, policy, audit, baseline, trends, analytics, and Snowflake/Postgres-backed stores now query natively by tenant rather than relying on broad reads plus in-memory filtering (#1558, #1559, #1561, #1562, #1567, #1569).
- **RBAC and control-plane hardening** — enterprise/compliance/auth-policy surfaces align on the current `admin` / `analyst` / `viewer` model with route-level and middleware-level enforcement kept in sync (#1576).
- **Monolith reduction in core surfaces** — `mcp_server`, `ast_analyzer`, Postgres stores, and console output were split into focused modules while preserving CLI/API behavior and published contracts (#1561, #1564, #1565, #1566).

### Fixed
- **Graph blast-radius hot path** — vuln-to-server edge resolution now uses indexed lookups instead of the prior nested agent×server cross-product in the graph builder (#1581).
- **HTTP retry behavior under load** — outbound retry backoff now adds positive jitter so concurrent OSV and HTTP clients do not back off in lockstep (#1582).
- **Tenant-blind enterprise reads** — baseline compare, trends, audit export, and related enterprise/operator surfaces now honor tenant scope consistently across backends (#1559, #1569).
- **Write-route audit coverage** — exception deletion, SIEM test, schedule mutation, fleet sync/state updates, and related operator write paths now emit audit entries with actor and tenant context.
- **Ignore-file error handling** — malformed YAML/JSON ignore files now fail through narrow parse errors instead of broad exception swallowing (#1582).

### Security
- **Hardened audit evidence chain** — audit HMAC coverage now includes payload `details`, routes fetch tenant-scoped audit entries at the store layer, and exported evidence stays tamper-evident across backends (#1559).
- **Transport and operator posture clarified** — HTTPS-external / trusted-boundary-internal deployment guidance, OTEL/OPA positioning, and current auth/RBAC behavior now match the live product and deployment docs (#1583).

### Docs
- **Release and deployment alignment** — README, Docker Hub README, product brief, EKS guidance, backend matrix, and release-managed version surfaces are aligned on `0.79.0`.

---

## [0.77.1] – 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Release metadata alignment** (#1498) — corrected 0.77.0 follow-up: brought `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and integration listings to a consistent 0.77.1 after an intermediate packaging drift

---

## [0.77.0] – 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **AST analyzer modularization** — JS/TS (#1424), Go (#1425), and shared models (#1420) extracted into focused helpers; SAST helper-chain findings reframed for clearer attribution (#1488)
- **MCP server modularization** — specialized tool registrations (#1439) and runtime helpers (#1438) split out of the main server module
- **Scanner modularization** — OSV helpers (#1418), runtime state helpers (#1417), risk/blast-radius helpers (#1416) split into dedicated modules

---

## [0.76.4] – 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Release-surface refresh** — README, PyPI, and Docker Hub now show the current product path with real screenshots, tightened copy, clearer architecture/graph visuals, and a shorter demo flow
- **CVE and graph drilldowns** — vulnerability rows and graph detail panels now provide richer fix, impact, compliance, and evidence context instead of acting like dead text

### Changed
- **Summary-first loading** — dashboard, jobs, activity, vulnerabilities, mesh, context, and insights now unlock from lightweight job summaries first and only hydrate deeper scan data when the active panel needs it
- **Graph defaults and fallbacks** — focused graph views, empty states, findings fallbacks, and posture labels now favor scoped, readable investigation paths over dumping full topology state at once
- **Docker freshness operations** — release automation now includes an explicit Docker `latest` refresh path so base-image fixes can be rebuilt and republished without waiting for a feature release

### Fixed
- **Snowflake SQL hardening** — notebook identifier quoting and `days` coercion now validate and escape values before SQL interpolation
- **Jobs summary contract** — pushed and completed scan rows now keep `completed_at`, `error`, and summary metadata aligned across API, dashboard, and jobs surfaces
- **App-router release build stability** — release pages that rely on search params now render safely under `Suspense`, fixing the current Next.js app-router build path
- **AST/SAST depth wave** — validator-aware guards, transformed-return sanitizers, JS/TS early exits, and cross-file helper modeling reduce false positives while improving Python, JS/TS, and Go parity

### Security
- **Container rebuild response** — Docker refresh and rescan wiring now close the loop for newly published Alpine fixes instead of relying on manual Docker Hub inspection
- **Snowflake query validation** — user-controlled notebook and date inputs are now coerced or quoted before execution, removing the identified injection and query-shape risks

---

## [0.76.2] – 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Patch release alignment** — managed release/version surfaces are now aligned on `0.76.2` for the next patch cut

### Fixed
- **Alpine package visibility** — local vulnerability DB sync now ingests Alpine secdb in addition to OSV, so Alpine package advisories like the recent `openssl` and `util-linux` fixes are detected without waiting on OSV lag
- **Alpine scanner coverage** — Alpine OS-package fallback queries now include `v3.23`, matching the current container base branch
- **Container hardening** — the Docker build now upgrades installed Alpine packages during both builder and runtime stages instead of only bumping `zlib`
- **Release image gating** — CI and release image scans now fail on fixable `MEDIUM+` and `UNKNOWN` image vulnerabilities while ignoring upstream-unfixed image findings

### Security
- **Container CVE response** — the patch release closes the fixable Alpine `openssl` and `util-linux` image findings and adds stronger pre-release guardrails to stop similar Docker regressions from shipping unnoticed

---

## [0.76.1] – 2026-04-09

### Added
- **CLI output parity for reporting commands** — `check`, `report diff`, and `report history` now have clearer machine-readable behavior, and reporting surfaces that were still missing `--quiet` now support quiet scripting flows
- **CLI troubleshooting coverage** — the shipped docs now include a dedicated debug guide for quiet mode, stdout vs file output, discovery triage, and verification workflows

### Changed
- **Patch release alignment** — release-managed files, Docker/Helm metadata, OpenClaw skills metadata, docs, registry surfaces, and action examples are now aligned on `0.76.1`
- **Verification status wording** — package provenance verification now distinguishes missing attestations from service unavailability instead of collapsing both into a generic unknown state

### Fixed
- **Quiet mode consistency** — reporting and analysis commands now suppress headings/export chatter when `--quiet` is requested
- **Verify JSON output** — `agent-bom verify --json` no longer prepends human console banners before the JSON payload
- **Graph contributor install contract** — graph centrality dependencies and contributor install paths were aligned so graph analysis works in a clean optional-extra install
- **Live MITRE/STIX parsing** — ATT&CK/CAPEC runtime parsing now handles the current upstream payload shape and restores live CWE→ATT&CK mapping
- **Docker Hub release hardening** — release sync, cleanup retention, and version-alignment checks now match the real Docker tag contract and fail loudly on drift
- **Release bump automation** — stale version-bump patterns were removed so dry-run and check mode only flag real managed release surfaces

### Security
- **Supply-chain verification clarity** — provenance verification now reports whether attestations are absent or temporarily unavailable, reducing ambiguous release-audit results for package verification

---

## [0.76.0] – 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Unified graph product path** — persisted snapshots, current-state and diff views, attack-path drilldown, search, impact, delta alert delivery, and Postgres-backed graph persistence are now part of the shipped CLI/API/dashboard flow
- **Multi-language AST/SAST depth** — Python, JS/TS, and Go analysis now include stronger cross-file and taint-aware coverage, plus SARIF import and cleaner custom-rule handling
- **Container layer attribution** — image findings now retain per-layer package provenance so output can show which layer introduced a vulnerable package
- **PDF report export** — `agent-bom scan -f pdf -o report.pdf` now renders the existing HTML report through an optional WeasyPrint-backed export path

### Changed
- **README and architecture visuals** — product positioning, hero commands, and architecture diagrams were shortened and tightened to match the current shipped path without overflowing cards or stale counts
- **Demo CLI polish** — demo and offline copy are shorter, and the scan path no longer prints redundant inner vulnerability banners when the outer progress bar is already rendering the step
- **Release-managed versioning** — docs, deployment files, Helm, OpenClaw, registry metadata, and action examples now align on `0.76.0`

### Fixed
- **Graph correctness and scale** — snapshot isolation, tenant propagation, search escaping, delta dispatch semantics, and direction-aware traversal/reporting were hardened across the recent graph lane
- **Scanner concurrency** — shared cache and scanner-global thread-safety issues were fixed and regression-tested
- **Container evidence depth** — package metadata now tracks layer/package occurrences instead of flattening away provenance
- **Release automation drift** — CodeQL SARIF upload is on v4 and no longer fails when a SARIF file was not actually produced

### Security
- **Release dependency refresh** — cryptography was bumped to `46.0.7`, clearing the active moderate buffer-overflow advisory on the locked release path
- **Graph delta delivery** — delta alerts now flow through the existing dispatcher/webhook surfaces instead of only being computed/export-ready

---

## [0.75.15] – 2026-04-04

### Added
- **API distributed tracing** — request-level `traceparent` propagation, `X-Trace-ID` headers, OTLP/HTTP export, and collector/reverse-proxy contract docs
- **Postgres-backed API rate limiting** — shared throttle state across replicas via `api_rate_limits`, keeping `429` and `Retry-After` semantics consistent
- **Skills AST-aware analysis** — fenced Python and JS/TS code blocks in skill/instruction files now get semantic risk detection for dynamic execution, shell/process execution, and file mutation
- **Skills output schemas** — `skills scan` and `skills rescan` now ship explicit versioned JSON schemas for stable downstream consumption
- **Helm monitoring surfaces** — readiness/startup probes, optional metrics service, optional `ServiceMonitor`, and runtime `/metrics` wiring for Prometheus-friendly deployments
- **Postgres enterprise persistence** — audit log and trend history now have Postgres backends with tenant-aware persistence

### Changed
- **Demo wording** — the built-in `--demo` path is now presented as a curated sample agent + MCP environment, while real local/project scans remain the primary product story
- **Tenant isolation posture** — enterprise stores, gateway policy surfaces, audit/trend history, and shared rate-limit state now align under the same tenant-boundary model
- **Security automation** — daily preventive workflows, deployment freshness checks, and authenticated Railway verification now better reflect real release state

### Fixed
- **GitHub Action enterprise networking** — proxy and custom-CA environment variables now pass through consistently during install and scan steps
- **OpenClaw packaging metadata** — stale skills test-count references were updated to current repo reality
- **Postgres schema drift** — schema summaries, RLS coverage assertions, and table counts now match the current tenant-bearing model

### Security
- **Postgres RLS completion** — all tenant-bearing Postgres tables now enforce row-level security, with shared caches and infra-only tables explicitly excluded from that boundary
- **Enterprise auth maturity** — RBAC route enforcement, OIDC tenant-claim scoping, authenticated request tracing, and shared rate-limiting now operate together as the production API contract

---

## [0.75.14] – 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Next.js Insights page** (`/insights`) — SupplyChainTreemap, BlastRadiusRadial, PipelineFlow, EpssVsCvssChart, VulnTrendChart wired to real scan data; treemap cells are clickable and drill down to `/vulns`

- **Compliance narrative CLI** — auditor-facing narrative export from saved scan reports via `agent-bom report compliance-narrative`
- **MCP caller governance** — per-caller rate limiting, request tracing, and richer tool metrics now flow through the MCP server metrics surface
- **Remote MCP startup contract** — Railway/remote deployments now use an explicit bearer-token contract instead of accidental anonymous exposure

### Fixed
- **JSON report import** — file upload now validates size (10 MB), schema, prototype-pollution keys, and finite numeric values before use (`ui/lib/validators.ts`)
- **`generated_at` TypeScript error** — `ScanResult` does not have `generated_at`; use `scan_timestamp` instead
- **JetBrains claim** — removed from active integrations; filed as issue #412 for proper implementation
- **`skills scan` path handling** — bundle identity now supports referenced files outside the primary file directory, fixing repo-local scans against shared security assets

- **`skills scan --verbose`** — added parity with other CLI surfaces for easier debugging
- **Runtime CLI warning noise** — async proxy tests now use async-aware mocks, removing unawaited coroutine warnings from that path
- **Frontend/backend scan contracts** — UI API types now model `scan_performance`, richer `scorecard_summary`, `posture_scorecard`, and remediation metadata consistently with backend JSON output
- **GitHub Action execution contract** — hardened argv handling, severity validation, pip caching, step summaries, and sanitized PR comment/report generation now match the documented Action behavior
- **Runtime image provenance** — runtime Docker image now builds from repo source instead of reinstalling from PyPI, aligning image behavior with source and release verification
- **MCP execution envelope** — sync and async tools now share bounded concurrency, timeout, metrics, path safety, and sanitized error handling
- **Snowpark enterprise networking** — Snowpark image now supports enterprise proxy and custom-CA configuration like the other maintained image families

### Security
- **JSON file upload** — `ui/lib/validators.ts` guards against DoS via oversized files, prototype pollution, and schema-invalid payloads (no new npm dependencies)
- **API and remote MCP fail closed** — non-loopback API and remote MCP transports now refuse to start without explicit auth unless an insecure override is deliberately supplied
- **Dependency security refresh** — LiteLLM was bumped to `1.83.0`, clearing the active 2026 GitHub security advisories on `main`

---

## [0.75.13] – 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Focused MCP server review** — `agent-bom mcp scan <server>` adds a narrower audit path for a single MCP server or command before adoption
- **Compliance narrative CLI** — compliance narrative export is now reachable from the CLI for release and audit workflows

### Changed
- **Release surfaces aligned** — README, PyPI, Docker Hub, site docs, Helm, OCI metadata, and publishing surfaces now share the same product description and release references
- **Canonical product story** — product positioning, Claude/Cortex integration references, and repo-derived metrics now point back to the canonical brief and generated metrics appendix
- **First-run guidance** — empty-state discovery help now shows concrete Claude, Cursor, Codex CLI, and Cortex CoCo config paths instead of circular retry suggestions
- **SARIF defaults** — SARIF export now auto-enables enrichment when online so severity context lands in GitHub and downstream scanners by default

### Fixed
- **Offline safety boundary** — offline scans now fail closed when the local vulnerability database is missing or incomplete instead of producing a false clean result
- **Incomplete result visibility** — critical scanner and enrichment failures now surface warning summaries instead of silently degrading to partial output
- **Skills scanning** — `agent-bom skills scan .` no longer crashes on repo-local path validation, and the command now supports `-v` / `--verbose`
- **Package checks** — `agent-bom check` now resolves ambiguous package names more safely and avoids cross-ecosystem false positives
- **Output format handling** — unknown output extensions now fail loudly instead of silently falling back to JSON
- **ClickHouse query hardening** — analytics escaping was tightened and the associated tests expanded
- **Release quality gates** — follow-up CodeQL, lint, mypy, FastAPI response-model, and regression issues from the stabilization lane were fixed before release

### Security
- The `0.75.13` release closes the remaining pre-release P0/P1 safety issues from the final audit lane, including offline false-clean behavior, incomplete scan signaling, and ClickHouse query hardening

---

## [0.75.12] – 2026-03-29

### Added
- **First-class skills scanning** — `agent-bom skills scan` and `agent-bom skills verify` are now top-level CLI surfaces for instruction-file trust, provenance, and findings

### Fixed
- **Blast radius serialization** — package name/version/stable ID now propagate correctly in filesystem and JSON outputs
- **Filesystem posture credibility** — fs/project scans no longer get penalized for missing MCP-only config context; posture and framework mapping now reflect the actual scan mode
- **Framework tagging** — intrinsic vulnerability findings now carry framework tags in both agents and fs modes
- **Remediation output** — remediation JSON now includes populated priority and action fields
- **UI dependency hygiene** — aligned UI eslint peer range with Next.js-supported versions to remove install drift
- **Scorecard source resolution** — npm/PyPI direct dependencies now fall back to source metadata resolution paths so repo URLs, homepages, and Scorecard repos populate end to end

### Security
- No new release-blocking regressions introduced across the `0.75.12` stabilization lane; focused regression suites, UI tests, build checks, and release consistency checks remained green

---

- scrypt KDF for API keys, HMAC constant-time comparison, parameterized SQL everywhere

## [0.74.1] – 2026-03-22

### Security
- **Runtime**: Fix threat level comparison — `ThreatLevel` enum uses ordinal comparison; previously `CRITICAL > HIGH` was `False` (lexicographic), so escalations were never detected
- **Runtime**: Per-session shield engine isolation — zero trust, no cross-session threat contamination
- **Runtime**: Rate limiter now blocks (HIGH/CRITICAL severity) instead of alert-only (MEDIUM)
- **Runtime**: HTTP protection server auth via `AGENT_BOM_PROTECTION_API_KEY` with constant-time comparison
- **Runtime**: Single zero-width space now detected (was requiring 3+ consecutive chars, bypass fixed)
- **Runtime**: Unicode path traversal (`\u002e\u002e`) detection added
- **Runtime**: 3 new credential patterns (HashiCorp Vault, AWS session tokens, PagerDuty) — 112 total
- **Runtime**: Drift baseline persisted to disk, survives engine restarts in shield mode
- **Supply chain**: Go module provenance verification via sum.golang.org checksum database
- **Supply chain**: Provenance results persisted in Package model (integrity_verified, provenance_attested)

### Fixed
- **Compliance**: Wire NIST 800-53 Rev 5 tags in scanner pipeline (was defined but never called)
- **Compliance**: Wire FedRAMP Moderate baseline tags in scanner pipeline
- **Policy**: Add 9 missing framework tag fields to policy engine expressions (all 14 frameworks now accessible)
- **Scanner**: Surface non-OSV ecosystem skips to users with per-ecosystem breakdown
- **Scanner**: Track per-package CVE lookup errors and report at scan completion
- **Scanner**: Add severity_source field for audit trail (cvss, osv_database, ghsa_heuristic)
- **Scanner**: Bound semaphore cache to 8 entries (prevents memory leak in long-running API servers)
- **Scanner**: Kill-switch state now persisted on stop() (was leaving stale blocked state on disk)
- **Cloud**: ECS/EKS/SageMaker discovery uses boto3 paginators (was missing results beyond page 1)
- **MITRE ATLAS**: Expanded from 8 to 30+ technique mappings across all tactic categories

### Added
- `make dev` — starts API server + Next.js dashboard in parallel

## [0.74.0] – 2026-03-21

### Dashboard & HTML Report

- **Sidebar navigation** — collapsible left sidebar replaces top nav across Next.js dashboard (18 pages) and HTML report, with 5 grouped sections, command palette (Cmd+K), active link highlighting, mobile drawer (#993)
- **React Flow edge fix** — topology graph nodes now connect properly with Handle components, eliminating all "null handle id" errors (#993)
- **Topology enhancements** — nodes show server count, vuln count, credential indicators; animated edges for vulnerable connections; zoom controls; empty state (#993)
- **HTML report sidebar** — fixed 220px sidebar with IntersectionObserver active section tracking, mobile responsive hamburger toggle, print-friendly layout (#993)

### Security

- **Dependency CVE fixes** — pillow ≥12.1.1 (CVE-2026-25990 PSD OOB write), protobuf ≥6.33.5 (CVE-2026-0994 ParseDict DoS), pyjwt ≥2.12.0 (CVE-2026-32597 crit header bypass), tornado ≥6.5.5 (CVE-2026-31958 multipart DoS, GHSA-78cv-mqj4-43f7 cookie injection)
- **CI/CD hardening** — all GitHub Actions pinned to SHA digests, no `@master` refs, scoped permissions

### Fixed

- **Dashboard layout** — wider content area (1400px), CSS page transitions, thin scrollbar, card hover effects
- **HTML report unused variables** — removed dead nav link variables (ruff F841)

---

## [0.73.0] – 2026-03-19

### Architecture

- **5-product CLI** — `agent-bom`, `agent-shield`, `agent-cloud`, `agent-iac`, `agent-claw` — one package, five entry points, zero duplication (#967)
  - `agent-bom` — BOM generation + vulnerability scanning
  - `agent-shield` — runtime protection (proxy, protect, guard, watch, audit)
  - `agent-cloud` — cloud infrastructure (aws, azure, gcp, snowflake, databricks, huggingface, ollama, posture)
  - `agent-iac` — IaC security (scan, policy, validate)
  - `agent-claw` — fleet governance (fleet, serve, api, schedule, report, connectors)
- **Shared entry point factory** (`_entry.py`) — consistent error handling + update check across all 5 products
- **Parameterized help categories** — each product shows relevant command groups in `--help`
- **Full backward compat** — `agent-bom runtime proxy`, `agent-bom cloud aws`, etc. still work

### Added

- **CycloneDX 1.6 ML BOM extensions** — native `modelCard`, `data` components, `machine-learning-model` type with `quantitativeAnalysis` for training metrics (#967)
- **Agent-shield deep defense mode** (`--shield`) — correlated multi-detector threat scoring, `ThreatLevel` escalation (NORMAL→ELEVATED→HIGH→CRITICAL), automatic kill-switch on CRITICAL (#967)
- **Graph-native AIBOM export** — `to_graphml()` for yEd/Gephi/NetworkX, `to_cypher()` for Neo4j with AIBOM node labels (AIAgent, MCPServer, Package, Vulnerability) (#967)
- **CLI graph formats** — `agent-bom graph --format graphml|cypher` alongside existing json/dot/mermaid (#968)
- **CLI shield flags** — `agent-shield protect --shield --correlation-window 30` (#968)
- **API: graph export** — `GET /v1/scan/{job_id}/graph-export?format=graphml|cypher|dot|mermaid|json` (#970)
- **API: shield control** — `POST /v1/shield/start`, `GET /v1/shield/status`, `POST /v1/shield/unblock` (#970)
- **MCP graph tool** — `graph_export` MCP tool for graphml/cypher/dot/mermaid from scan results (#972)
- **agent-cloud new commands** — `snowflake`, `databricks`, `huggingface`, `ollama`, `posture` (#967)
- **agent-claw fleet** — `fleet sync|list|stats` commands + `connectors` command (#967)

### Fixed

- **Fleet min_trust Python 3.14** — explicit `float()` coercion + defensive `(trust_score or 0.0)` (#969)
- **API test noise** — mock `_run_scan_sync` with pytest `monkeypatch` fixture scoped to test file only (#970)
- **flatted 3.4.1→3.4.2** — GHSA-rf6f-7fwh-wjgh prototype pollution in `/ui` (#970)
- **CVE-2026-33231 suppression** — nltk wordnet_app remote shutdown (not reachable — never imported) (#971)
- **Stale test name** — `test_total_agent_types_is_18` → `is_31` (#967)

---

## [0.72.0] – 2026-03-19

### Added

- **30 MCP clients** — added Pieces, mcp-cli, Trae, Aide, Void, Replit Agent, Aider, Sourcegraph Cody, Tabnine, Copilot CLI, Junie, JetBrains AI
- **AI BOM tools** — 32 MCP tools for scanning, compliance, runtime, cloud in the `0.72.0` release
- **Version accuracy** — all surfaces updated with correct version and client counts
- **Compliance noise reduction** — actionable findings only in default output

---

## [0.71.4] – 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **SARIF output**: paths were absolute (`/Users/.../Agent-Bom`) causing GitHub Security tab to show "No summary of scanned files". Now relative paths pointing to manifest files (#945)
- **Scanner accuracy**: git commit SHAs in `fixed_version` from OSV data no longer generate false positive "assuming affected" warnings — silently skipped as non-version data (#946)
- **Docker pip CVEs**: upgraded pip in all 6 Docker images — fixes CVE-2025-8869 (5.9M) and CVE-2026-1703 (2.0L) (#947)
- **Release pipeline**: self-scan gate now blocks ALL publish jobs (PyPI, Docker, GHCR, Sigstore, SLSA). No release ships with HIGH+ CVEs (#944)
- **Self-scan noise**: post-merge scan now only uploads HIGH+ findings to GitHub Security tab (was uploading all severities, flooding with 78 low-severity base-image CVEs) (#945)

## [0.71.3] – 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Scanner accuracy**: empty string versions no longer silently bypass OSV queries — now logged as unresolvable (#933)
- **HTTP reliability**: all 19 `urllib.request.urlopen` callers migrated to httpx with exponential backoff, Retry-After handling, and configurable timeouts (#878, #932)
- **Context graph OOM**: BFS queue bounded at 10,000 entries + O(1) cycle check via frozenset to prevent memory explosion on dense deployments (#877, #930)
- **Docker Hub token leak**: `release.yml` now masks API token with `::add-mask::`, validates before use (#929)
- **CI self-scan gap**: added `agent-bom scan --os-packages` inside built Docker image to catch base-image CVEs (glibc, sqlite3, dpkg) that Docker Hub found but CI missed (#931)
- **Alpine CI image**: pinned `python:3.12-alpine` by SHA256 digest (#929)
- **Glama Dockerfile**: added missing HEALTHCHECK (#929)
- **Container rescan**: weekly container image rescan escalated from informational to exit-code 1 with warning annotation (#931)
- **action.yml**: shortened description to 91 chars (was 141, GitHub Marketplace truncates at 125) (#933)

### Added
- **CMMC 2.0 in REST API**: wired 17 CMMC practices into `/v1/compliance` endpoint — 14 frameworks now accessible via API (#933)
- **Sync HTTP client**: `create_sync_client()`, `sync_request_with_retry()`, `fetch_bytes()`, `fetch_json()` in `http_client.py` (#932)

## [0.71.2] – 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Symlink cycle in parser walk** — `_walk()` now tracks visited real paths via `os.path.realpath()` to prevent the same directory being scanned up to 5× through symlinks (#876)
- **Transitive dep fetch failures now logged** — silent `except (ValueError, KeyError): pass` in npm/PyPI fetch functions replaced with `_logger.warning()`; gather exceptions also routed through logger in addition to console (#879)

### Docs
- ARCHITECTURE.md — added `agent-bom run` node to CLI Commands subgraph wired to Runtime Proxy
- SKILL.md — bumped version, Docker tag, Sigstore reference, and test count to current values

---

## [0.71.1] – 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **GHSA false positives (authlib, pyjwt)** — GitHub Advisory API now returns `patched_versions=null`; `vulnerable_version_range` is the authoritative field. Added `_installed_version_is_affected()` helper parsing compound constraints (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`). Fixed packages already past the vulnerable window no longer flagged (#895)
- **Empty-version packages passed to scanners** — packages with `version=""` were unconditionally matched against all advisories. Added `""` to the scannable exclusion filter in `scanners/__init__.py`
- **NVIDIA scanner unconditional matches** — CSAF vulns with a `fixed_version` now call `compare_versions()` before appending; unversioned packages skipped
- **Proxy credential detection in error responses** — `check_credentials` was only applied to `"result"` fields; JSON-RPC `"error"` objects can carry exception messages with API keys. Now applies to both (#896)
- **Rate limit advisory-only** — `--rate-limit` logged alerts but never blocked. Enforcement block path added matching replay-detection pattern (#896)
- **Audit log rotation silent failure** — `except OSError: pass` replaced with `logger.warning()` to surface disk-full/permission errors (#896)

---

## [0.70.4] – 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Cloud provisioning scripts** — read-only, least-privilege provisioning for all 11 providers (AWS IAM + EKS RBAC, Azure Managed Identity, GCP Workload Identity, Snowflake key-pair JWT, Databricks PAT/OAuth, HuggingFace fine-grained token, W&B Viewer service account, Nebius IAM, CoreWeave namespace RBAC, NVIDIA NGC Viewer key) in `scripts/provision/`
- **Nebius pagination** — cursor-based pagination with `nextPageToken`/`next_page_token` wired into all 3 discovery functions
- **Post-merge self-scan** — GitHub Actions workflow scans agent-bom with agent-bom on every merge; blocks release on critical CVE (#648)
- **Two-tier severity gate** — `--warn-on` for CI warning gates, `--fail-on-severity` for hard failures (#625)
- **External scanner JSON ingestion** — import supported scanner JSON output with blast radius enrichment (#624)
- **Delta scanning** — `--delta` flag reports only new findings since last scan; exit code based on new-only (#630)
- **Local embedded vulnerability database** — SQLite schema, OSV/EPSS/KEV sync, fast lookup (#631)
- **Bun, NuGet (.NET), pip-compile parsers** (#660)
- **Gradle and conda parsers** for AI/ML ecosystems (#659)
- **go.sum integrity verification** + GOPROXY version resolution (#658)
- **Maven Central and crates.io** version resolution for unpinned deps (#661)
- **GHSA and NVD local DB sync** sources (#653)
- **Multi-source asset deduplication** — cross-cloud dedup with stable IDs (#654)
- **Deterministic UUID v5 stable IDs** for assets and findings (#655)
- **Auto-refresh stale vuln DB flag** — `--auto-refresh-db`, NIM/NeMo/NemoClaw NVIDIA tracking
- **Production-quality Go/Maven/RPM** parser improvements (#656)

### Fixed
- **Credential security** — URL validation (jira.py, slack.py), timing-safe metrics token compare (proxy.py), API key sanitization from exception messages (vector_db.py) (#662)
- **Databricks enum bug** — `EndpointStateReady.value` fix; `str(enum)` returned full name not value, causing all serving endpoints to be skipped (#664)
- **CoreWeave/NVIDIA provisioning** — kubeconfig + namespace RBAC, NGC Viewer key, DCGM exposure detection (#664)
- **Normalization gaps** — CLI check, scan_agents, rescan, postgres cache (#615)
- **GHSA PEP 503 normalization** — advisory matching + resolver debug logging (#619)
- **Multi-arch container rescan** — arm64 support, SARIF to Security tab (#650)
- **OTel hardening** — schema validation, file size cap, framework expansion (#642)
- **Stale DB warning** on outdated local cache (#642)
- **Local vuln DB security** — chmod 0600, HTTPS-only sync, path validation, integrity check (#634)
- **HTML report** — delta/warn-gate banners, vendor_severity display (#632)
- **Silent exception handlers** — logging added to all bare `except` blocks (#620)
- **Documentation accuracy** — detector count (6→7), architecture client and tool counts (#657)
- **MCP tool count** — replaced hardcoded counts with dynamic assertions (#626)

### Changed
- **`cli/scan.py` refactored** — 3,079L monolith → modular `scan/` package (#651)
- **Unified Finding model Phase 1** — core dataclasses, BlastRadius migration shim, dual-write (#628)
- **PEP 503 name normalization** — configurable batch size, unresolved package warnings (#614)
- **server.py routes extracted** — scan, discovery, connectors, governance, enterprise, schedules, observability, assets (#612, #613)

---

## [0.60.1] – 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **P0: Ecosystem case normalization** — packages with ecosystem `"PyPI"` (uppercase) were silently returning 0 vulnerabilities. Fixed with `.lower()` normalization at every `ECOSYSTEM_MAP` lookup in `query_osv_batch` and `scan_packages`.
- **P0: OSV detail enrichment** — OSV `/v1/querybatch` returns only `{id, modified}` per vuln (no summary, CVSS, aliases). Added parallel detail fetching via `/v1/vulns/{id}` (semaphore=10), called at every return path including cache-hit early returns.
- **P0: Cache blocking I/O** — SQLite cache writes now run off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread` + batched `put_many()` transaction, preventing event loop stalls on large scans.
- **Zero test failures** — `test_accuracy_baseline.py` fully fixed: lowercase ecosystem, `asyncio.run()`, correct `Severity` enum values.

### Added
- **Update notifications** — background daemon thread checks PyPI on startup, 24-hour file cache at `~/.cache/agent-bom/`, non-blocking notice shown on clean exit.
- **Improved `--version` output** — shows Python version, platform, and external scanner install status.
- **Better first-run UX** — zero-config scan shows actionable quick-start commands.

### Changed
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten — Quick start (5 min), good-first-issue guide, architecture table, DCO, security report path.
